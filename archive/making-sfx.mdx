Sounds are essential to every game, they should be a reward to the player's ears.
But how to make sound effects that actually work?

# Layering
The first rule one shall follow is layering. One source of sound alone usually doesn't cut it, when we hear multiple different textures at once we find the sound more pleasing.

## Case study
<AudioPlayer src="/audio/making-sfx/dash.wav" />
For my project ElementalRift i had to create a sound effect for the dash mechanic.<br/>
So instinctively me and my friends started brainstorming on how a dash should sound like. First thing that comes to mind is the wind, a fast _shhhhhhhhhh_, sort of the sound of air going through your hair while riding downhill on a bike.



So we got to work - in this case we were in school, and we found some really cool textures!
The main part of the sound was not something we expected, but a loud fan started going off in the room, we recorded that on my phone and it sounded like this:

A dash also needs a starting noise so we just hit random objects in the room, recording it with my phone.
